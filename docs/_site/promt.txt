In this folder "docs", create a Jekyll style webpage for this replication package of an academic paper. It will be deployed as GitHub Pages. 

The information of the paper and the contents of the repo is described in "README.md". 

The new front page should have at least two items in the navigation bar.
1. The package's contents.
2. The information about using docker for strong replication.

Keep links to the outside R and Stata packages into the index page.
